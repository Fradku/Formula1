# Formula 1

New to the Python language, or rather programming, I look to find ways for me to apply everything I learned into my Formula 1 hobby. 

## Database
Folder containing all the data that are required to run the programmes. As a beginner that is unfamiliar in reading and writing .csv files, which most published F1 data or statistics, I converted few F1 related data into .txt format. 

With these Formula 1 data in .txt format readily available, I hope this can help other beginners.
